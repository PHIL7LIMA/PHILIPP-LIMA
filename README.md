# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm PHILIPP LIMA
Software Quality Analyst with experience in manual functional testing. I have skills in bug detection and reporting, test case management, and agile methodologies (Scrum). I use testing tools such as Cypress, JIRA, and Postman, and have knowledge of scripting languages like JavaScript. I am excellent at effective communication, problem-solving, and attention to detail, and am committed to continuous improvement and learning. My goal is to ensure the quality and functionality of applications and systems.
With a background and experience in physiotherapy and people and company management, I bring an analytical and detail-oriented approach to the testing process, designing test cases to ensure that products not only meet technical requirements but also align with business needs.
